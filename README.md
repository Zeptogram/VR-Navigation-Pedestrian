## Project Structure  

Several reorganized folders structure the project, most notably:

- **Agents**: Contains all scripts and objects related to agents, particularly ML-Agents, including brains and prefabs.  
- **Artifacts**: Contains all scripts and objects related to the artifact system.  
- **Characters**: Includes all avatars and 3D models used to represent virtual agents in the environments, along with animations and animation controllers to properly animate and manage them.  
- **Maps**: Contains all environment-related objects, such as buildings, terrains, and props.  
- **Scenes**: Contains all scenes implemented in the project; this is the core folder housing the actual simulated environments.  
- **PedPy**: Contains scripts and output files used by PedPy to analyze agent behavior.  
- **Resources and Scripts**: Contain generic prefabs, audio, and scripts used throughout the project.  
- **Oculus, XR, and XRI**: Contain the logic and components required for VR compatibility.
